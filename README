Compiling under Unix. Taken from a message by ed at the audiocoding.com forum. Thanks!

the linux tools are munted by the CR/LFs all over the place ... to make then happy once again, all lines need to be terminated by LF alone

how to sort this problem ?, well stick the following script into a file, unzip faad, run the script on the faad directory (it'll recursively fix all files), then continue with sh bootstrap ....


#!/bin/bash

if [ -d $1 ]; then
for i in $1/*; do
./$0 $i
done
else
mv $1 tmp
cat tmp | tr -d \\r > $1
rm tmp
fi
