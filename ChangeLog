2000-02-24  thebard
		Removed remainign thread and semephore code

		After more compilation, there is not any function thats taking
		more than 10% of the total time (see the profile graph) For fun
		I added threads to psy6, but since its only 7 seconds, the
		constant rebuilds of the threads gain little improvement, and
		will suck on non multiple cpu boxes, so I removed it.

2000-02-23  lenox
		fixed wildcards processing

2000-02-23  thebard
		Now encoding faster than realtime with suggested compiler
		options in Makefile. Still alot of room left for assembler and
		or thread tweaking.

		Alterations so that we can thread functions for multiple CPU's

		mosterous cache misses. More to come.

2000-02-22  thebard

2000-02-09  oxygene2000
		Added additional implementation of rdft using fftw (from rank 1 to rank
		>20 in my profiler = a lot faster)

		Added fixed fftw-stuff. Use rdft_spectrum2.c instead of rdft_spectrum.c
		and set -DUSE_FFTW in Makefile to enable it..
		Be sure that you have libfftw installed
		fftw_init() and fftw_destroy() have to be placed elsewhere
		(should only be run once in the program -> speed)

		Another mistake, argh!

		Placed fftw_init/destroy where they have to be
		Removed transfo.h as it isn't needed
		Added rdft.h

2000-02-09  menno

		accurate delay estimation

		Better quantization of short blocks

2000-02-08  oxygene2000
		really small speed-up in psy_step6
